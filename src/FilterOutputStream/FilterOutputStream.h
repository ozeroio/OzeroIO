/**
 * Ozero IO
 *
 * This class is the superclass of all classes that filter output
 * streams. These streams sit on top of an already existing output
 * stream (the <i>underlying</i> output stream) which it uses as its
 * basic sink of data, but possibly transforming the data along the
 * way or providing additional functionality.
 * <p>
 * The class <code>FilterOutputStream</code> itself simply overrides
 * all methods of <code>OutputStream</code> with versions that pass
 * all requests to the underlying output stream. Subclasses of
 * <code>FilterOutputStream</code> may further override some of these
 * methods as well as provide additional methods and fields.
